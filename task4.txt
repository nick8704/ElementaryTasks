My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENT
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENT
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENTperfumes is there more delight
Than in the THIS IS LINE TO COUNTbreath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENT
My mistress, when she walks, THIS IS LINE TO COUNTtreads on the ground:THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
As any she belied with THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENTfalse compare.

THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENT
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
