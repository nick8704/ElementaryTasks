My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENT
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENT
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENT
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare.

THIS IS LINE TO COUNT

THIS IS LINE TO REPLACEMENT
THIS IS LINE TO COUNT THIS IS LINE TO COUNT
